# Trends-in-Common-Male-Names-using-Gephi

A name is a powerful thing. It is a crucial factor in developing your sense of self.
It is a descriptor that allows people to make quick judgments and assumptions about us.
When a new person introduced themselves to us, our first instinct is to assemble a rough mental sketch of everyone we have ever known named the same.
Maybe someone named the same bullied us in school or they were once our good friend. We subconsciously judge this person, at least a little, based on all the other people we know named the same.
Now with increasing usage of unique names, it is not that common for us to meet people with same names.
However, in this project I have attempted to find the most common names in males for the years 2015 and 2020 so that this data can be used further for analysis.
I have created two Gephi social networks for the year 2015 and 2020.
In both the networks, the different names of males are at the center of the network.
The various states comprises the boundary of the network.
The states are placed in the network according to the geographical location of the  respective state on the United States map.
For the year 2015, I divided the states region wise and created 5 more Gephi social networks for each region.
The data being used is made up of top 5 most common names used and subsequently the most common name is connected to its respective state with an edge having weight 5. 
The least most common name is connected to state with an edge having weight 1.
